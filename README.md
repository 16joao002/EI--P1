# EI--P1

"Programação 1" was the first class about programming, memory management, pointers, structs... in my Computer Science degree. This repository serves as the central hub for my learning about C in this class, it contains all my work done in class and out of it!

## Resources

### Development Tools
- [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) - IDE for C programming
- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) - GNU Compiler Collection

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Introduction to C Programming**
   - Overview of the C language
   - Setting up the development environment
   - Basic syntax and program structure

### 2. **Data Types and Operators**
   - Fundamental data types in C
   - Arithmetic, relational, and logical operators

### 3. **Control Flow**
   - Conditional statements (if, else, switch)
   - Looping constructs (while, for, do-while)

### 4. **Functions in C**
   - Function declaration and definition
   - Passing parameters and returning values
   - Function prototypes and headers

### 5. **Arrays and Strings**
   - Working with one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays
   - Manipulating strings in C

### 6. **Structs**
   - Defining and using structs

### 7. **Pointers and Memory Management**
   - Understanding pointers and pointer arithmetic
   - Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, calloc, realloc, free)
   - Memory management best practices and avoiding memory leaks

### 8. **File I/O**
   - Reading from and writing to files in C
   - File handling and error checking
   
## Coding Standards
- Follow best practices for code readability.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Document your code to enhance understanding.
